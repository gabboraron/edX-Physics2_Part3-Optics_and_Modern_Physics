![ An idealized ocean wave passes under a sea gull that bobs up and down in simple harmonic motion. The wave has a wavelength λ, which is the distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave. The up and down disturbance of the surface propagates parallel to the surface at a speed vW](https://openstax.org/apps/archive/20221219.191545/resources/8cf22e054bb2d969c9479ed35f9d3699ef4ade12)

- $T$ The time for one complete up and down motion is the wave’s period. => The wave’s frequency is $f=1/T$ .
- The water wave in the figure also has a length associated with it, called its wavelength $\lambda$, the distance between adjacent identical parts of a wave, the distance parallel to the direction of propagation.
- wave velocity $v_W$, the speed of propagation: $v_W = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f\lambda$
  - this is the speed of a surface wave;
  - for sound, $v_W$ is the speed of sound
  - for visible light, $v_W$ is the speed of light


> *Many people think that water waves push water from one direction to another. In fact, the particles of water tend to stay in one location, save for moving up and down due to the energy in the wave. The energy moves forward through the water, but the water stays in one place. If you feel yourself pushed in an ocean, what you feel is the energy of the wave, not a rush of water.*
